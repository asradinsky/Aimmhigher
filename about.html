            <p>I am passionate about helping students, professionals, and lifelong learners unlock their potential
                by strengthening the mental skills that power success — focus, organization, time management,
                and self-regulation. With a skill for breaking down complex concepts into clear, actionable steps,
                my approach is to meet each client where they are and guide them toward practical strategies that
                fit their unique learning style.</p>
            <p>My journey into Executive Function Coaching began in the classroom, but my passion for
                helping others succeed has taken me far beyond it. I started as a teacher, committed to guiding
                entire classes through their learning journeys. Over time, I realized the greatest impact I could
                make came from working with individuals—digging deeper into their unique strengths,
                challenges, and learning styles. That insight led me to become a reading teacher, providing one-
                on-one support that transformed both skills and confidence.</p>
            <p>At the same time, my personal life brought its own lessons. As a parent of children with ADHD,
                Executive Function Disorder, and anxiety, I experienced firsthand the struggles that bright,
                capable people can face when organization, time management, focus, and emotional regulation
                don’t come easily. I dove into the research, took courses, sought out strategies, and began to see
                how these tools could change lives—not just for my children, but for anyone navigating
                academic or professional challenges.</p>
            <p>Today, I works with high school students preparing for college, college students managing new
                independence, and adults balancing careers, education, and life transitions. My coaching blends
                compassion, evidence-based strategies, and practical tools, helping my clients move from feeling
                overwhelmed to feeling empowered. My message is clear: with the right support, every person
                can learn the skills to thrive—in school, at work, and in life.</p>
