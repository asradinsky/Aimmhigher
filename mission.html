            <p>As a teacher, I loved helping students discover their strengths, but I also saw how many
                struggled in ways that traditional classrooms weren’t built to support. Some had reading
                difficulties that made every page feel like a mountain to climb. Others had ADHD or executive
                functioning challenges that made organization, planning, and follow-through overwhelming. I
                realized these struggles weren’t about ability—they were about needing the right strategies,
                tools, and encouragement to shine.</p>
            <p>That realization, coupled with the struggles I was experiencing first hand with my own children,
                led me to create a space outside the classroom, where I could work with children, teens, and
                adults one-on-one. My goal has always been simple: to meet people where they are, honor the
                way their brains work, and help them build skills that make life feel a little more
                manageable—even when life gets messy.</p>
            <p>The symbols I chose to represent this work mean so much to me. The <b>butterfly</b> reminds us that
                growth takes many forms—each stage beautiful in its own way. It also represents the flitting or
                rapid movements of the ADHD brain, and it’s wiring to seek stimulation. The <b>rainbow</b> colors
                reflect the wide spectrum of neurodivergence—each person unique, vibrant, and full of
                possibility.</p>
            <p>The <b>infinity loop</b> shows that our minds hold endless potential, with no limits on how we can
                learn, adapt, or shine.
                Together, they honor the journey of neurodivergent minds—ADHD, autism, anxiety, and
                beyond—celebrating resilience, transformation, and the infinite beauty of thinking differently</p>
            <p>Aimm Higher grew from my belief that neurodivergent individuals don’t need to be
                “fixed”—they need to be understood, supported, and celebrated. Every coaching session is a
                chance to build confidence, uncover strengths, and create strategies that empower people of all
                ages to move from feeling stuck to discovering their own version of success.</p>
