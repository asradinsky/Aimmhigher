            <h2>What is Executive Functioning?</h2>
            <p>At its core, EF coaching is the science and art of guiding learners to strengthen their own
                capacity to <b>get things done</b>.</p>
            <p>Think of it as your brain’s “control center”. It helps you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Plan</b> what needs to be done</li>
                <li><b>Organize</b> materials and information</li>
                <li><b>Manage time</b> effectively</li>
                <li><b>Start tasks</b> without procrastination</li>
                <li><b>Stay focused</b> despite distractions</li>
                <li><b>Adapt</b> when plans change</li>
                <li><b>Regulate emotions</b> so they don't derail you</li>
                <li><b>Remember</b> information while using it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These skills work together to let you decide, act, and adjust.
                They’re essential for everything from finishing a work project to remembering to pay bills on
                time, or even following a recipe without skipping steps.</p>
            <p>When executive functioning is weak everyday life can feel scattered or overwhelming — even
                when a person is intelligent and capable in other areas.</p>

            <h2>How Executive Function Coaching Helps</h2>
            <p>Executive Function coaching is a specialized type of support helping you to: </p>

                <li>Develop stress management techniques for managing emotional dysregulation</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Executive Function Coaching isn't about "fixing" someone.</b> It's about equipping them with practical tools, self-awareness, and habits that allow them to <b>plan, adapt, and follow through consistently.</b></p>
